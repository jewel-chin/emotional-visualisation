Welcome to our Space!

This is a generative art project created by Jewel and Kieran. Our work offers introspection by invoking emotional qualities through the transformation of messages into art. This machine allows participants to witness how their emotions can manifest visually, offering a unique perspective into the latent weight that words can carry. It captures subtle shifts in intensity and expression, transforming nuanced variables into a visual narrative that reveals the embedded emotions within each message

To test our machine, we collected a range of messages with varied sentiments via a survey that takes participants on an emotional journey from calm to frustration. As users answer questions, they experience delayed loading times, with the speed of the responses becoming progressively slower. This gradual drag acts as a psychological probe, testing the limits of patience and revealing how frustration begins to manifests in their typing behaviour and tone.

For the visual component, we employed text processing techniques such sentiment analysis and tracking the number capitalisation words as frustration escalates. Our base visual is inspired by the iconic Rorschach inkblots — a psychological tool that invites viewers to project their own emotions onto abstract forms. We adapted this structure to reveal something deeper: each participant’s raw emotional data shapes the contours and shades of a visual unique drawing. These dynamic visualisations serve as a mirror, presenting themselves as a representation of a journey of calm to frustration, invoking introspection and a collection sense of shared emotions.

Since our project is generative, each participant’s data feeds into a system that continuously creates new visuals, ensuring that no two are ever the same. This process reveals the fluidity of emotions and generates a dynamic gallery of expressive, data-driven visuals.

The gallery you see is a product of the data we have gathered, and can be seen when you close this modal :)
